This repository contains the my leanings on Data-structure and algorithm with 100days of coding challenge  

Day 1 : Creating custom HashMap ( ManjuMap :-)) 
 I have create the custome hashmap( ManjuMap which will performs all the put and get function )
 
Day 2 : Creating resizable Array 
In order to resize the Array:

	  size of the array and copy all the items 
2. remove : When the Array is
	  qudrilatral size then halve the size of the array.
