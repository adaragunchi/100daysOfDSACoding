# 100daysOfDSACoding
This repository contains the my leanings on Data-structure and algorithm with 100days of coding challenge  

Day 1 : Creating custom HashMap ( ManjuMap :-)) 
 I have create the custome hashmap( ManjuMap which will performs all the put and get function )
 
Day 2 : Creating resizable Array 
In order to resize the Array: 
1. insert : When Array is full then double the
	  size of the array and copy all the items 
2. remove : When the Array is
	  qudrilatral size then halve the size of the array.
	  
Implentation of Queue Using Linked List:
Enqueue :  Insert the element at the end of list.
Dequeue :  Delete the element from the beginning

Day 3: Selection sort
    1.Take the first element as the Min then compare that with rest of the array.
	2.If you found that if left element in the right array is less than element
		 in the left array then exchchnage
